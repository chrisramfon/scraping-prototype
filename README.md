# scraping-prototype
This is a test that I made for learn about web scraping.

This little code navigates to buldar.com and takes the first user name of the posts. It's refreshing by periods of 10 minutes and if it detects a new user name then sends a notification with the username.

This code is only for academic proporuses.
